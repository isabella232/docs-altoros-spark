title: Using Altoros Spark for PCF

This topic describes how developers create and bind instances of the Altoros Spark for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

After deploying the Apache Spark for PCF tile, the Apache Spark service appears in the Marketplace.
Developers can use either the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) or
Apps Manager to create a service instance and bind it to apps.
Binding instances is the process of creating unique credentials for each app to access the database.

##<a id='cf-cli'></a> Create and Bind a Service Instance Using the CF CLI

To create and bind an instance of the Altoros Spark for PCF using the CF CLI, perform the following steps:

1. Set API endpoint to the Cloud Controller of your deployment.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
  OK
  API endpoint:  <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.59.0)
  Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
  </pre>
1. Log in to your deployment and select an org and a space.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>
1. List the Marketplace services and choose the Altoros Spark for PCF.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf marketplace
	Getting services from marketplace in org system / space administrators as user<span>@</span>example.com...
	OK

	service       plans            description
	spark-odb     standalone       Apache Spark Service
  </pre>
1. Create an instance of the Altoros Spark for PCF.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf create-service spark-odb standalone YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
	Creating service instance YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE in org system / space administrators as user@example.com...
	OK
	</pre>

1. Before binding the app, first check that the service has been created.
   You can do this by using `cf service INSTANCE_NAME.`
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf service YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE

	Service instance: YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
	Service: spark-odb
	Bound apps:
	Tags:
	Plan: standalone
	Description: Apache Spark
	Documentation url:
	Dashboard:

	Last Operation
	Status: create succeeded
	Message: Instance provisioning completed
	Started: 2017-09-15T12:39:14Z
	Updated: 2017-09-15T12:45:19Z
	</pre>

1. Bind the instance to an app.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf bind-service YOUR-APP YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
  Binding service YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE to app YOUR-APP in org system / space administrators as user@example.com...
  OK
  TIP: Use 'cf restage YOUR-APP' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
  </pre>
1. Restage the app for the binding to take effect.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf restage YOUR-APP
  </pre>

##<a id='apps-man'></a> Create and Bind a Service Instance Using Apps Manager

To create and bind an instance of the Altoros Spark for PCF using Apps Manager, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to `apps.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` in a browser and log in.
1. Click **Marketplace** in the left navigation.
1. Click **Apache Spark**.
1. Select the `standalone` service plan.
1. Enter an **Instance Name** and select a space under **Add to Space**.
   To bind the service instance to an app, select an app under **Bind to App**.
1. Click **Add**.
  You can also bind an app to a service instance by navigating to the app page,
  clicking **Services**, then clicking **Bind a Service**.
1. Select a service instance to bind to the app and click **Bind**.
